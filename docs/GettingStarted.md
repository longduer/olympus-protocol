# Olympus Derivatives

The technology of blockchain open the gate to a lot of new distributed and secured cryptocurrencies that start to become each time more and more popular, creating a new financial ecosystem. However, the nature of this cryptoworld is not realiable, with highst rises and fallings of values, common for a not mature ecosystem.

The market must madurate, part of the process of maduration is the creation of more complex and developed tools that allow investors to create security in their own assets. This new financials productos already start to appear in the market, how ever, there is big diversity of posilities to be developed, and each investor has his own needs.

Thats the point Olympus will support you, Olympus is not just a proposal of financial products, but the knowhow, the templates, the tools and the support to allow you to become a solidity developer and create your own financial products.

Olympus project is based on a three levels:
  a) The core: a set of helpfull components that can be utilize for any financial product making much easier to customize your own derivative. The core works under Olympus environment and use MOT (Mont Olympus Token) as a internal currency for concrete transactions.

  b) Financial products: Different templetes, from basic empty templetes ready for customization to complete finiancial products where you can do a modification and are ready to deliver.

  c) The DAPPS: External applications (webs, apps) that use in a different way our protocol and financial products. We will also provide you the tools to connect externally to the protocol as well as your own financial products.


2. How to fork/clone the project.

We can start cloning Olympos Protocol Template. from the [Olympus repository](https://github.com/Olympus-Labs/olympus-protocol)

IMAGE HERE

We simple need to fork the proyect, that will make a copy of the proyect in your own repository, where you can edit and track your on progress. Later on even you can contribute your code into the main Olympus repository.

Now we need to clone the repository in our own compouter. Clicking in
clone the repository, we will get provide with the repository URL.

For example, thats the URL of my own for.

> https://github.com/abelbordonado/olympus-protocol.git

In order to start to work we need to make sure some tools are installed in our system.

First Install Node and NPM
> https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm

Install your favourite GIT tool:
> https://git-scm.com/downloads
For simplicity, al git commands we will execute following git in terminal.

Second, we recommend Code Visual Studio as the editor the team of Olympus is mostly using.
> https://code.visualstudio.com/


Finally download the repository from your editor or on a terminal
> git clone https://github.com/abelbordonado/olympus-protocol.git

3. Folder structure introduction.

- Scripts: ????

- Tests: All the products are carefully tested and you are recommended to follow same as carefully. We will explain how to in the next sections.

- Contracts: Contracts is where all solidity code is storaged.
  + Interfaces: Describes the comunication layer between contracts.
  + Olympus Protocols: Where you will find all the templates and olympus products ready to be edited and customized.
  + Libs: Some basic solidty libraries for common purpose.
  + Component Containers: ** TO CREATE ** Contracts that hold our products and components get listed in the block chain.

  that are in herit by the templates and all the list of provider that contians our ecosystem.



4. Pick up the basic template.
5. Introduce the template itself by linking to the page.
6. Tell him where to add code.
7. Introduction of how to compile, unit test and deployment, merge.

8. Introduce remix or MEW.
