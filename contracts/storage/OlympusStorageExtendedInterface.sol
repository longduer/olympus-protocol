 * @dev This contract, for now, can be used to store simple bytes32 key pairs.
 * These key pairs which are identifiable by their objectId and dataKind
 * Such as strategy, order, price, etc.
 * The purpose of this interface is that we can store custom data into this contract
 * for any changes in the requirements in the future. Each part of the Olympus core
 * should have options to add custom data to their respective dataType, by using
 * this contract.
 * The functions will always be the same, the implementation of the functions might change
 * So the implementing contracts should be able to modify the configured address of this contract
 * after deployment.
